let sum = 5+ 5+"5";

console.log(sum);


// let m = 5+5+"Hey"+"Hello";

// console.log(typeof m);

// the first + operates an addition to the first 5 that are of type number
//because the value after the second + is a string , the sum already found is converted implicitly to a string and is concatenated with the string "5" therefore the output is 105 which is of type string
